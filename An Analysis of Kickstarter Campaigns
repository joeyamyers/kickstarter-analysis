# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
Data analysis was performed on over 4000 crowdfunding projects to uncover any trends that could prove helpful for Louise and her Kickstarter campaign. I generated insights in order to better advise Louise in meeting her own project's fundraising goal. 

### Purpose
The goal of this analysis is to help playwright, Louise, with her crowdfunding campaign on Kickstarter. The insights derived from the data of 4000+ Kickstarter campaigns will be used to coordinate Louise's own Kickstarter and set her up for success. Additionally, the analysis will help Louise gain a better understanding of the successful aspects of comparable projects that she can then apply to her own project.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
![Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch](path/to/Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch.png)

Pivot tables and charts were utilized to determine whether a campaign's launch date had any bearing on its outcome. I filtered the pivot table based on the year and the theater parent category to compile projects most similar to Louise's. The outcome of each theater Kickstarter was aggregated and organized according to which the month the Kickstarter began. 

I created a chart (seen above) in order help visualize the findings from the pivot chart. With each month of the year as the X-axis and the agggreagted count of each outcome on the Y-axis, the chart made it apparent which months were most and least successful based on launch date.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

Finding the outcome of Kickstarter projects based on goals was very similar to the process of finding the outcomes based on launch date. Each project was organized into a specific goal range based on its own goal and then aggregated based on the outcome (Successful, Failed, Canceled). The projects per goal range were totaled to find the rate at which each project was successful, failed, or canceled. 

These findings were easier understoood by the chart above. I created a line graph showing the trends of each outcome with the goal outcome ranges as the X-axis  and the outcome percentages as the Y-axis. The graph made it clear to see that as the goal ranges increased, the success rates declined.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
Based on the data show in this chart, I determined that May and June are the optimal months for launch dates for theater kickstarters. These two months have far higher success rates than other months. I also determined that the worst time period to launch a theater kickstarter is nearing the end of the calendar year.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
I found there to be a general inverse relationship between success rate and the Kickstarter goal amount. The data showed that as the goal amount ($) increased, the percentage of successful Kickstarters declined. Additionally, larger projects aiming to raise more than $50,000 failed almost 60% of the time. Louise's estimated goal of $12,000 placed her in the goal range with a 48% succesful outcome based on this data.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
There are a few limitations in this dataset: lack of descriptive data (ie. intended age group, age of backers), two, three. More descriptive data in relation to  outcomes would have been more advantageous for Louise's overall marketing strategy.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
It would have been advantageous to visulaize the potential correlation between the Kickstarter outcome and the amount of the days the campaigns lasted. This relationship would be beneficial for Louise's marleting strategy. An addititonal pivot table detailing the relationship between...
