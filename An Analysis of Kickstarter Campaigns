# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
I received data on the fundraising goals of 4000+ Kickstarter projects to determine how to advise Louise in meeting her fundraising goal for her project. 
The outcome of each Kickstarter was deeemed "successful", "live", "failed", or "canceled" based on whether the fundraising goal was met by supporters.
