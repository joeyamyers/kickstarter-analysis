# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
I generated insights based on data from 4000+ Kickstarter projects in order to better advise Louise in meeting her own project's fundraising goal. 
Depending on whether each project's Kickstarter goal was met, the project's outcome was deemed "successful", "live", "failed", or "canceled".
To better the chances in meeting Louise's fundraising goal, I subsetted the data to analyze which factors including the amount of backers per 
project, the duration of each Kickstarter campaign, etc. were correlated to a certain outcome.
 
Louise is trying to gget her new theater project funded through Kickstarter. This Kickstarter analysis was undertaken in order to generate insight to help 
Louise's project gget the funding it needs to one day come to fruition.
...educate Louise in making the put Louise in the best position to succeed in attaining her Kickstarter goal.


### Purpose

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
![Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch](path/to/Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch.png)

Pivot tables and charts were utilized to determine whether launch date had any bearing on a Kickstarter's outcome. I filtered the pivot table based on the year
and the theater parent category to compile projects most similar to Louise's. The outcome of each theater Kickstarter was aggreagted and organized according 
to which the month the Kickstarter began. 

I created a chart (seen above) in order help visualize the findings from the pivot chart. With each month of the year as the X-axis and the agggreagted count 
of each outcome on the Y-axis, the chart made it apparent which months were most and least successful based on launch date.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

Finding the outcome of Kickstarter projects based on goals was very similar to the process of finding the outcomes based on launch date. Each project was 
organized into a specific goal range based on its own goal and then aggregated based on the outcome (Successful, Failed, Canceled). The projects per goal range
were totaled to find the rate at which each project was successful, failed, or canceled. 

These findings were easier understoood by the chart above. I created a line graph showing the trends of each outcome with the goal outcome ranges as the X-axis 
and the outcome percentages as the Y-axis. The graph made it clear to see that as the goal ranges increased, the success rates declined.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
Based on the data show in this chart, I determined that May and June are the optimal months for launch dates for theater kickstarters. These two months have far higher success rates than other months.
I also determined that the worst time period to launch a theater kickstarter is nearing the end of the calendar year.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
I found there to be a general inverse relationship between success rate and the kickstarter goal amount. The data showed that as the goals increased, 
the percentage that the kickstarters were successful declined. Additionally, projects aiming to raise more than $50,000 failed almost 60% of the time. 
Louise's estimated goal of $12,000 placed her in the goal range with a 48% succesful outcome.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
There are a few limitations in this dataset: one, two, three.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
I believe that it would be advantageous to subset the data to fit the exact criteria of Louise's kickstarter campaign.
